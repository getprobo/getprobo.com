      <div class="animate-slide-in animation-delay-550">
        <p>
          Instead of building yet another “classic SaaS,” we chose a different
          path: delivering an end-to-end compliance service. We don’t just give
          companies tools to achieve SOC 2 in record time - we run the compliance
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That ambition came with a price: time. At one point we were handling
          more clients in parallel than Bryan and I could realistically support.
          Bryan even stepped in as a full-time compliance officer. We kept our
          standards high, even saying no to new clients rather than compromising
          on quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, things are almost back under control. Our processes are stronger,
          our team is growing (reach out if you are a CISO or compliance officer),
          and we are back on track toward our objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          YC was the best thing that could have happened to us and Probo: Doing
          things than don’t scale is hard, but it’s worth it!
