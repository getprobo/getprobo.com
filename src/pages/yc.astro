      <p>
        Instead of building yet another “classic SaaS,” we chose a different
        path: delivering an end-to-end compliance service. We don’t just give
        companies tools to achieve SOC 2 in record time - we run the compliance
        for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That ambition came with a price: time. At one point we were handling
        more clients in parallel than Bryan and I could realistically support.
        Bryan even stepped in as a full-time compliance officer. We kept our
        standards high, even saying no to new clients rather than compromising
        on quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, things are almost back under control. Our processes are stronger,
        our team is growing (reach out if you are a CISO or compliance officer),
        and we are back on track toward our objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        YC was the best thing that could have happened to us and Probo: Doing
        things than don’t scale is hard, but it’s worth it!
