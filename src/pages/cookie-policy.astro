          These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be
          switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by
          you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your
          privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.

        <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
          measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
          which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
          around the site.

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings
      preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies,
      you may worsen your overall user experience, as it will no longer be
      personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings
      like login information.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>

      changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or
      regulatory reasons. Please re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay
      informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
