Our mission is to make compliance accessible for everyone without
paying an unfair premium. Compliance should be simple, not a painful
journey. We are building the best possible product to make compliance
enjoyable. We'll help you embrace compliance!

Antoine is an ISO 27001 auditor and Bryan is a YC alumnus software
engineer who led SOC2/ISO27001 compliance at his previous startup. We
started Probo because we were tired of expensive compliance tools that
offer basic templates behind sales calls and unpredictable
pricing. Based in Paris, we're building the open-source alternative we
needed ourselves.
