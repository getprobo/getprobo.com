We're transforming compliance from a complex burden into an intuitive
journey. Our platform makes compliance straightforward and
cost-effective, empowering businesses of all sizes to meet regulatory
requirements with confidence. Let us guide you toward effortless
compliance management.

Antoine, an ISO 27001 auditor, and Bryan, a YC alumnus and engineer
who managed SOC2/ISO27001 compliance at his previous startup, founded
Probo in Paris. Frustrated by expensive compliance tools with opaque
pricing and basic templates hidden behind sales calls, we built the
open-source solution we wished existed.
