SOC 2 compliance has become an essential requirement for businesses.

To sum-up in a few words the usual process to be SOC 2, here is what to expect:

1. Get the SOC 2 framework and compare it to what you are doing
2. Implement what you think is missing - it can be security measures (e.g. 2FA),
   processes (e.g. access review) or policies (e.g. third party management
   policy)
3. Ask a third party auditor (CPA from AICPA) to evaluate your stickiness to the
   framework

Whether or not you agree with what it stands for, most companies can’t avoid it.
Achieving SOC2 requires both time and financial investment, and costs can
quickly escalate when factoring in productivity losses, required processes, and
employee training.

So, how much does it really cost? For a company with fewer than 20 employees,
total expenses can range from $6,000 to $30,000.

Let’s break it down

## The Audit

Typically seen as the final step for SOC2, it’s crucial to understand the
variations in audits to fully grasp the cost differences.

- **Trust Service Criteria (TSC):** Security, Availability, Privacy,
  Confidentiality, and Processing Integrity.
  - SOC 2 audits can focus on one or more criteria. The simplest audits cover
    Security only, making them more affordable, while audits covering multiple
    criteria increase in complexity and cost.
- **Types of SOC 2 Audits:**
  - **Type 1:** Evaluates the company security controls at a single point in
    time. It’s faster and less expensive.
  - **Type 2:** Assesses the operational effectiveness of these controls over a
    period (3 to 12 months). It’s longer and a bit more expensive.

For a small business, audit costs typically start at $5,000 and can exceed
$15,000.

**Small business budget**: $6,000–$7,000 is reasonable.

## Implementation or lost productivity

Before the audit, you need to implement everything that you think is necessary
(security policies, processes, and controls). Given the scope, it is hardly
doable by a junior staff alone (even if ressources can be scarce). Assigning a
dedicated owner for SOC 2 is highly recommended. This person should:

- Act as an executive sponsor (you want people to act)
- Manage the project
- Have expertise in IT, security, and legal requirements (at least some
  understanding)

With an automation platform, this hidden cost is often overlooked. Without a
platform, companies should expect at least six months of full-time work (or hire
a consultant) at a cost of $50,000+.

Now, using an automation platform reduces costs to approximately $10,000
(negotiation is key—check your pricing
[here](https://compliance-benchmark.replit.app/)). These platforms streamline
the SOC 2 process but still require human oversight and can take 1 to 3 months
to implement efficiently.

For those looking for budget-friendly alternatives, open-source options exist,
such as Probo and Comply (from StrongDM), which can significantly cut costs as
you access the knowledge for free.

**Small business budget**: least possible, the value is not in the
knowledge/content, but in the help you get. Aim less than $3k for content alone

## Tooling or services

There are plenty of things you could invest in (as always today), but the two
coming most often are penetration test and security training.

### Penetration Testing

Despite common misconceptions, penetration testing is not mandatory for SOC 2
(to be fair, nothing is). It may not even make sense in early-stage companies.
If your product is still evolving, waiting until technical stability can be more
strategic.

That said, penetration testing is an excellent security investment (prefer
manual ones).

**Small business budget:** Proper penetration tests start at $5,000.

### Security Training

Security awareness training for employees is another consideration. Plenty of
free resources exist, and some companies offer free tiers for small businesses.

**Small business budget:** $100 a month is plenty

## Maintain it

Once compliance is achieved, annual maintenance is required. This means
revisiting all costs from the first year.

Early on, companies don’t necessarily need a full compliance program—just the
SOC 2 report. Smart businesses minimize unnecessary processes to save time and
costs.

For example, instead of using a complex ticketing process for managing access
for your employees, a simple Slack channel where employees request and get
approval (with timestamps as records) can suffice.

**Small business budget:** same as the previous steps

## Conclusion

SOC 2 compliance is an important investment, but it doesn’t need to cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. By being strategic and pragmatic,
businesses can significantly reduce time and financial burdens—allowing them to
focus on what truly matters. For a small business, one week a year and $10k is
already a huge investment and that is plenty for SOC2

# **How much does SOC 2 really cost?**

SOC 2 has become a must-have for many businesses. Whether or not you agree with
it, you’ll probably need it. But it doesn’t have to be painful or absurdly
expensive.

Here’s what you actually need to budget for and where you can avoid unnecessary
spending.

## **What the SOC 2 process looks like**

1. Compare the SOC 2 framework to what you’re already doing.
2. Implement what’s missing—this could mean adding security measures (e.g.,
   2FA), policies (e.g., third-party management), or processes (e.g., access
   reviews).
3. Hire a third-party auditor to assess your compliance.

Sounds simple. But costs can stack up fast.

## **How much the audit costs**

The SOC 2 audit is your official proof of compliance. Costs depend on the scope:

- **Type 1 Audit** – A one-time snapshot of your security controls. Faster,
  cheaper.
- **Type 2 Audit** – Assesses your security over a period (3-12 months). Takes
  longer, costs more.

**Budget:** For a small business, $6,000–$7,000 is a reasonable budget.

## **The hidden cost of implementation**

Before the audit, you need to put policies, controls, and security measures in
place. That takes time, effort, and someone to own it.

Who’s doing the work?

- **Your team:** Expect at least 6 months of effort—often a full-time job.
- **A consultant:** That’ll run you $50,000+ (and you’ll still have to do a ton
  of work).
- **An automation platform:** Brings costs down to $10,000 but still requires
  oversight.

**Budget:** For small businesses, less than $3,000 should go toward content—the
real cost is in execution.

**Budget-friendly option:** Open-source tools like Probo or Comply (from
StrongDM) let you access knowledge for free and cut costs.

## **What’s worth paying for**

Not everything the compliance industry pushes is necessary.

### **Penetration testing**

SOC 2 doesn’t require penetration testing. For early-stage startups, it might
not even be useful—your product is still evolving, and security testing makes
more sense once it stabilizes.

If you do go for it, manual testing is worth it.

**Budget:** A proper penetration test starts at $5,000.

### **Security training**

Security training for employees is a good investment, but don’t overpay. Plenty
of **free resources exist**, and some vendors offer free tiers for startups.

**Budget:** $100/month is more than enough.

## **Keeping SOC 2 costs low every year**

Once you get your SOC 2 report, you’ll need to maintain compliance annually. But
that doesn’t mean bloated processes or expensive tools.

Example: Instead of a complex ticketing system for access management, a simple
Slack channel with timestamped approvals works just fine.

**Budget:** No need to scale expenses unnecessarily, stick to the same costs as
your first year.

## **The bottom line**

SOC 2 compliance doesn’t need to cost six figures. With a lean approach, small
businesses can stay compliant for around $10,000 per year, without wasting time
or money on unnecessary complexity, so they can focus on what truly matters:
building their business.
