SOC 2 compliance has become an essential requirement for businesses.

To sum-up in a few words the usual process to be SOC 2, here is what to expect:

1. Get the SOC 2 framework and compare it to what you are doing
2. Implement what you think is missing - it can be security measures (e.g. 2FA),
   processes (e.g. access review) or policies (e.g. third party management
   policy)
3. Ask a third party auditor (CPA from AICPA) to evaluate your stickiness to the
   framework

Whether or not you agree with what it stands for, most companies can’t avoid it.
Achieving SOC2 requires both time and financial investment, and costs can
quickly escalate when factoring in productivity losses, required processes, and
employee training.

So, how much does it really cost? For a company with fewer than 20 employees,
total expenses can range from $6,000 to $30,000.

Let’s break it down

## The Audit

Typically seen as the final step for SOC2, it’s crucial to understand the
variations in audits to fully grasp the cost differences.

- **Trust Service Criteria (TSC):** Security, Availability, Privacy,
  Confidentiality, and Processing Integrity.
  - SOC 2 audits can focus on one or more criteria. The simplest audits cover
    Security only, making them more affordable, while audits covering multiple
    criteria increase in complexity and cost.
- **Types of SOC 2 Audits:**
  - **Type 1:** Evaluates the company security controls at a single point in
    time. It’s faster and less expensive.
  - **Type 2:** Assesses the operational effectiveness of these controls over a
    period (3 to 12 months). It’s longer and a bit more expensive.

For a small business, audit costs typically start at $5,000 and can exceed
$15,000.

**Small business budget**: $6,000–$7,000 is reasonable.

## Implementation or lost productivity

Before the audit, you need to implement everything that you think is necessary
(security policies, processes, and controls). Given the scope, it is hardly
doable by a junior staff alone (even if ressources can be scarce). Assigning a
dedicated owner for SOC 2 is highly recommended. This person should:

- Act as an executive sponsor (you want people to act)
- Manage the project
- Have expertise in IT, security, and legal requirements (at least some
  understanding)

With an automation platform, this hidden cost is often overlooked. Without a
platform, companies should expect at least six months of full-time work (or hire
a consultant) at a cost of $50,000+.

Now, using an automation platform reduces costs to approximately $10,000
(negotiation is key—check your pricing
[here](https://compliance-benchmark.replit.app/)). These platforms streamline
the SOC 2 process but still require human oversight and can take 1 to 3 months
to implement efficiently.

For those looking for budget-friendly alternatives, open-source options exist,
such as Probo and Comply (from StrongDM), which can significantly cut costs as
you access the knowledge for free.

**Small business budget**: least possible, the value is not in the
knowledge/content, but in the help you get. Aim less than $3k for content alone

## Tooling or services

There are plenty of things you could invest in (as always today), but the two
coming most often are penetration test and security training.

### Penetration Testing

Despite common misconceptions, penetration testing is not mandatory for SOC 2
(to be fair, nothing is). It may not even make sense in early-stage companies.
If your product is still evolving, waiting until technical stability can be more
strategic.

That said, penetration testing is an excellent security investment (prefer
manual ones).

**Small business budget:** Proper penetration tests start at $5,000.

### Security Training

Security awareness training for employees is another consideration. Plenty of
free resources exist, and some companies offer free tiers for small businesses.

**Small business budget:** $100 a month is plenty

## Maintain it

Once compliance is achieved, annual maintenance is required. This means
revisiting all costs from the first year.

Early on, companies don’t necessarily need a full compliance program—just the
SOC 2 report. Smart businesses minimize unnecessary processes to save time and
costs.

For example, instead of using a complex ticketing process for managing access
for your employees, a simple Slack channel where employees request and get
approval (with timestamps as records) can suffice.

**Small business budget:** same as the previous steps

## Conclusion

SOC 2 compliance is an important investment, but it doesn’t need to cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. By being strategic and pragmatic,
businesses can significantly reduce time and financial burdens—allowing them to
focus on what truly matters. For a small business, one week a year and $10k is
already a huge investment and that is plenty for SOC2
