description: Why traditional compliance tools fail and how open-source can fix the industry's pricing and flexibility issues.
---

In our past experience, my cofounder & I faced a harsh reality with
compliance tools:

- Basic functionality hidden behind a $10k paywall
- Rigid, one-size-fits-all solutions that are not tailored to your
  business
- No guidance, leaving you guessing what you actually need to do

That's why we are building Probo.


## The Compliance Tool Trap

When building a new product, you're juggling dozens of
priorities. Then suddenly, a customer asks for SOC 2 report.

1. You will take a 30 minutes sales call to get a price indexed on how
   desperate you are
2. You pay to access a 80 tasks board and 20 templates that are the
   same for a F500 or a small company
3. You invest time to complete this generic board list, and realize
   you have to pay for an external auditor ontop of your tool
4. As you grow and add new framework, the bill get insanely high for
   the exact same templates and tasks.

Ultimately, you end up implementing measures you don't need,
maintaining processes you barely understand, all while paying premium
prices for basic functionality. After speaking with over 100 founders,
one thing is clear: everyone feels extorted and locked into these
platforms.

## Time for a change: open-source compliance

Here is our vision of how compliance should work: 

- **Core frameworks and templates should be free:** We’re making those
  tasks and templates freely available to everyone. The fundamentals
  of compliance shouldn't be locked behind paywalls.

- **Complete data ownership:** Your
  compliance data belongs to you. You should not be locked in a
  supplier that will end up charging you $100k+ as you grow just
  because you can’t easily leave.

- **Build your own integrations instead of taking endless
  screenshots:** If an integration is missing, feel free to build it
  and add it to the product. It will save you time in the long run and
  benefit the whole community.

- **Pay only for actual value-added services, with transparent
  pricing:** You should be able to test the product before you
  buy. Our price will always be fair, transparent and predictable.
